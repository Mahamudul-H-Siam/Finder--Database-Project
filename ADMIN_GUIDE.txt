# Admin Post Management - Quick Guide

## Issue: Posts showing as "Available" instead of "Pending"

**Solution:** Run this in phpMyAdmin to fix existing posts:

```sql
UPDATE MARKETITEM SET Status = 'Pending' WHERE Status = 'Available' OR Status IS NULL OR Status = '';
```

Then refresh the admin panel - you'll see approve/decline buttons!

## How Approve/Decline Works

**For Pending Posts:**
- ✅ **Approve** button (green) - Makes post visible
- ✗ **Decline** button (yellow) - Hides post

**For Other Posts:**
- Only **Edit** and **Delete** buttons show

## Quick Test

1. Click "Pending" stat card (shows 0)
2. Run the SQL above
3. Refresh page
4. Now you'll see posts with approve/decline buttons!

## The buttons are already there!
They just only show for posts with Status = 'Pending'
